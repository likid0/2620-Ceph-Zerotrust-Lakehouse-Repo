Welcome to the IBM Storage Ceph ZeroTrust LakeHouse

The IBM Storage Ceph Troubleshooting workshop is an in-depth Ceph
enablement that strives to provide you with a good understanding of the Core Ceph
Concepts & Architecture, The content of the workshop is a technical Hands-on  Break and Fix Lab.

== Recommended Pre-Requisites before starting the enablement. 

Before completing this course, there are some previous Tech-Zone Labs that we
would recommend doing first; here is the list of Storage Ceph training available in Tech-Zone
We would recommend completing the following before starting this enablement:
. https://techzone.ibm.com/my/reservations/create/6567862cba056800175b6279[Install and Configure a Ceph Cluster] : Learn to set up a robust IBM Storage Ceph environment from scratch and deploy the Object Storage service using the Dashboard.
. https://techzone.ibm.com/my/reservations/create/66c880e5eff555001e6e3582[Explore Advanced Object Storage Features] : Dive deep into SSL configuration, bucket policies, audit logs, Storage Class Tiering, and lifecycle management to enhance the security and efficiency of your object storage.
. https://techzone.ibm.com/my/reservations/create/66c882763c41c8001e807f3c[Experience Unified Storage] : Gain hands-on experience with Cephâ€™s unified storage capabilities, including Block (RBD), File (NFS), and Object (S3), showcasing its versatility as an all-in-one storage solution.
These labs demonstrate how IBM Storage Ceph can meet diverse enterprise storage needs, providing a scalable, secure, and unified storage solution. By mastering the deployment and management of block, file, and object storage within a single platform, organizations can streamline their storage infrastructure, improve operational efficiency, and reduce costs while ensuring data availability and integrity across various workloads.
